    "# Final project logistics\n",
    "You will work on this project in groups of 3. You must work in a group. Part of the point of this project is to give you experience working on a collaborative software engineering and data science project. That can’t happen if you work alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must work with group members from the same skills lab section. This is because all of you need to be present at the same time to give your project presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should join a final project group on Canvas. You can find instructions for how to do that hereLinks to an external site.. Make sure you join a group named “Final Project Group X”. Once you find a group, link up with them over email or Discord.\n",
    "\n",
    "Barring extenuating circumstances, you will not get credit for completing this project alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final project overview\n",
    "### The best neighborhood in Pittsburgh\n",
    "For the final project you will work as part of a team to answer the question: What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?  Using data from the WPRDCLinks to an external site.Links to an external site., you will create a data driven argument to support your claim about the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh.\n",
    "\n",
    "With your group members, you will be creating a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate your argument and the data analysis you did to support it. You will present your arguments to the class in the last two weeks of lab sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question you need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Come up with a team name!\n",
    "* As a group, come up with some ways of defining and measuring \"bestness\". This doesn't have to be a serious metric, it could be whimsical or secretly \"worstness.”\n",
    "* Each group member will be responsible for one submetric each.\n",
    "* Use at least 3 datasets in your argument. The easiest way to meet this requirement is for each member to choose their own unique dataset to analyze their submetric.\n",
    "* Note that if you are working in a group of 2, you still need at least 3 datasets. One of you will have to analyze two datasets, or you will have to work together on analyzing a third dataset.\n",
    "* Combine your sub-metrics into a single metric as you see fit.\n",
    "* Create a git repository to store your data, notebooks and code.\n",
    "* Note: There is a lot of subjectivity here, to wit, what does \"best\" mean? One of your tasks in this project is to come up with your own metric for \"best\" and then use it to analyze data to determine the best neighborhood. The goal of this final project is to work as a team to develop a metric, apply it, and write up the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could define \"best\" as the smartest and then define smartness as the \"number of advanced degree holders living in the neighborhood\". You might also define best as the ratio of the ”number of potholes\" and the “number of trees” in the neighborhood (lower or higher, the decision is up to you). How you want to measure bestness is up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, have fun with this project. Be creative. Think outside the box. Play with stuff. Break Jupyter a couple of times. Find an odd dataset and figure out a way to use it. The WPRDC is (figuratively) your oyster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook structure\n",
    "It is best to think about your final project as a data-driven report. You will need to put everything into a Jupyter notebook with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduction: Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.\n",
    "* The Metric: Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?\n",
    "* The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",
    "* Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.\n",
    "When your group presents your findings to your lab section (see below), the presentation will cover all of the above categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responsibilities\n",
    "While this is a group project, each group member has their own responsibility. In addition, all group members have responsibilities as a group. Basically, the best success will be found by those who work as a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Individual responsibilities:\n",
    "* Maintain your own notebook where you use a sub-metric to find the \"Best\" neighborhood in Pittsburgh\n",
    "* Make sure the group repo has the personal notebook\n",
    "* Write a conclusion\n",
    "#### Group responsibilities:\n",
    "* Have a group repository that contains all work done\n",
    "* Combine individual metrics into your final, overarching metric\n",
    "* Name a neighborhood as “Best” according to your analysis\n",
    "### The Github repo\n",
    "There are some key things that need to be included in your repository. Think of this project as a combination of all of the things we learned in skills labs this semester, with a focus on the last few weeks. So, there are some minimum requirements of files and information you will want to put in your group repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final report Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* Each group member's personal notebook(s) (Show your work)\n",
    "* A Readme that contains:\n",
    "Team name\n",
    "Team members and their email addresses\n",
    "Description and links to the datasets used\n",
    "A one sentence overview of your repository, meant for someone who is not familiar with the project\n",
    "### Presentations\n",
    "The final two weeks of this lab will be presentation weeks; half of the groups will present each week. Presentations should last a maximum of 10 minutes, with 5 minutes of discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can prepare slides or you can present from a notebook directly, but it will be easiest to use the notebook. We understand your analysis will be in progress, but you should have some initial results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group member should be able to talk about their metric and what data they're using to measure it. You should describe what conclusions you came to on your own. Then, your group should describe how you combined your metrics, and state which neighborhood was the best according to your combined metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you present, you will open up the floor for questions from your UTA and your fellow classmates. Part of your grade depends on giving satisfactory answers to your student questions. Additionally, you need to ask at least one other group a question at some point during these two lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you are presenting in the first week, the presentation expectations are slightly lower as you've had a week less to work on the project. However, we still expect all of the components, just less polish. Most final report feedback will come without any score loss unless you are missing large portions of the project. If you present in the second week, we expect a finished project that, at most, needs only minor tweaks. You may lose some scores if the presentation or report isn't complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding environment\n",
    "As with all of the skills labs, you will work on your final project in  Jupyter Notebooks. You have spent all semester practicing using the terminal and Jupyter notebooks, and you’ll put those skills to use.   Remember, you can use the Center for Research Computing's (CRC) Jupyter Hub or Anaconda.   You need the VPN for CRC's Jupyter Hub. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally for skills labs, we give you the link to a GitHub repository that you clone to access the lab materials. For the final project, it will be a little different. Here’s the workflow for getting started:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of you will create a repository on GitHub \n",
    "* Add the other group members as collaborators.\n",
    "* Each group member clones the repository on their JupyterHub account\n",
    "* Each group member will create their own Jupyter notebooks and push them to the shared repository.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is the same workflow that you learned about in the Version Control lab! However if you need a refresher, the UTAs and instructor are always happy to help!\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "If JupyterHub simply has not been working for you all term, you can use this Binder link to an external site. to access a coding environment for the final project. Don’t forget that if you are working on Binder, you need to download your notebook to your computer to save it. Additionally, you will need to re-clone your team’s repository."
